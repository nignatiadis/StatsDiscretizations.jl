It extends the discretization beyond the grid by including intervals from -∞ to the first grid point and from the last grid point to +∞.\n\nThe type parameters L and R specify the endpoint types of the intervals (e.g., Closed or Open), T is the element type of the grid, and G is the type of the grid vector.\n\nFields\n\ngrid::G: The grid of points used for discretization.\n\nExamples\n\ngrid = [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]\ndiscr = RealLineDiscretizer{Closed,Open}(grid)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#StatsDiscretizations.unwrap-Tuple{Any}","page":"Home","title":"StatsDiscretizations.unwrap","text":"unwrap(x)\n\nUnwraps the value x.
